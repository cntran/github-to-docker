  <h1>Sample App for Github CI/CD pipeline with Docker containers</h1>
  <p>
    This is just a standard static html page. Make changes to this file and push to git repo to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.
    On push, a Github action is set up as defined in .github/workflows/docker.yml to build and push a new Docker image up to Docker Hub.

    Testing auto builds configured on Docker Hub endpoint. (Conflict with GH actions??)
